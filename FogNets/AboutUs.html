  <div class="transbox">
    <p>FogNets aim to provide an innovative low-cost solution to the consistent water crisis that has been impacting Lebanon among other countries in the Middle East. The FogNets technique is eco-friendly that aims at meeting the water demand in a specific area through benefiting domestic, agricultural, industrial, governmental and non-governmental sectors equally by fulfilling their water needs. This technique is designed as a development-oriented technique that aims at satisfying the humanitarian needs for clean water in water scarce areas. </p>

  <div class="transbox">
 <p> Water scarcity has been an issue in the late years, especially in the MENA region. FogNets is a brilliant idea that targets water scarcity by getting water out of fogs. Lebanon is rich with various water resources. However, due to security and political turmoil and socio-economic challenges, Lebanon’s infrastructure including that for water supply has been vastly poor and mismanaged leaving Lebanon with a consistent water crisis. Many Lebanese and residents in Lebanon suffer from lack of access to water and poor quality of the water supplied. The severity of this crisis varies seasonally. Additionally, the influx of a huge number of Syrian refugees exacerbated the water crisis in Lebanon leaving many people in a humanitarian need for basic services. One of these essential needs is access to clean water. Consequently, Lebanon under this exacerbating pressure on water supply and the inadequate supply of clean water must seek non-conventional techniques to provide clean water supply. One of the contemporary methods; that has been tested in different countries and areas including one in north Africa; Mount Boutmezguida located southwest of Morocco, is the fog harvesting technique. This technique provides an alternative source of clean water without excessive exhaustion of the available water resources like the geological aquifers founded beneath.</p>

 <div class="background">
  <div class="transbox">
  <p>The company’s goals vary from achieving economic growth and profitability to enhancing environmental and living standards. FogNets aim primarily to provide maximum water coverage for local and surrounding communities (Lebanon and the MENA Region). Such a goal is a cornerstone that lays the foundation for subsidiary goals descending from it to collaborate in the main goal attainment. However, these subsidiary goals are not as less as important as the main goal. Providing a fully scale water coverage certainly comes with providing clean water services through utilizing state-of-the-art innovative technologies that are feasible and beneficial such as the mesh net made up of polyethylene itself. In order to ensure high quality water for all users, FogNets will also develop and implement a comprehensive set of environmental justice guidelines for use in connection with its operations and project in Lebanon. This will lead in strengthening and supporting the participation of local communities in improving water and sanitation management.
